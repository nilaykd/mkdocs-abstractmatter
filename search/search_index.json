The novel \u2018The Da Vinci Code\u2019 spoke about a plot where the scientists at CERN had successfully\u00a0created anti matter. Typically if\u00a0anti matter comes in contact with matter\u00a0it would annihilate each other leaving behind pure energy. It is hence believed that particle and anti particle were buzzing into existence during the birth of the universe, the big bang. Majorana fermions on the other hand are fermions which are its own antiparticle and its bound states are governed by non-abelian statistics.</p> <p>This concept maybe hard to grasp, but Dr. Leo Kouwenhoven could not have explained it better in his FOM (Fundamental research on matter)\u00a0lecture\u00a0at Veldhoven in 2013. As he explained, lets consider a chain of fermions such as electrons with a hole at one end. Due to the potential difference the electron has a tendency to immediately fill up the hole to attain equilibrium. Subsequently, it pulls all the remaining electrons along with it to occupy the empty space, this creates a hole at the other end of the chain. The process continues back and forth until it comes to a point where the electron and hole are now superimposed at both ends. Thus, there is a 50% chance of either finding a hole or electron at this point on both ends. This is the majorana fermion, a particle that is its own anti matter.  </p> <p></p> <p>   Image Source: Link </p> <p>The discovery and manipulation of majorana has major implications in the field of quantum computing. The possibility of not having bits 1 and 0 but also having both together at the same time increases computation speed marginally. What incites curiosity is\u00a0exploring topics like electron teleportation and actuation through induced localized surface plasmon resonance. The scope of LSPR induced spin dynamics is massive.</p>","tags":["quantum","mechanics"]},{"location":"blog/2023/12/14/introduction-to-multi-touch-attribution-modeling-part-1/","title":"Introduction to Multi-Touch Attribution Modeling Part-1","text":"","tags":["modeling","marketing","attribution"]},{"location":"blog/2023/12/14/introduction-to-multi-touch-attribution-modeling-part-1/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Consumer decisiveness is always subjective to the experiences under a common context. The attitude of a consumer towards a purchasing behavior is always influenced by a multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors are internal to the individual and can include aspects such as personal beliefs, attitudes, perceptions and personality. </p> <p>Typically these are shaped over years of social engineering from the surrounding environment and interactions. Extrinsic factors on the other hand are external influences are more short term that impact the consumer behavior such as exposure to marketing activities, product features, quality, social influences and so on. The combination of these intrinsic and extrinsic factors translates onto how a consumer interacts with different touchpoints around and moreover what steps one takes before making a final purchase. These steps and interactions cover whole decision journey as best personified by David Edelman and Marc Singer.  </p> <p>Imagine a data scientist who is asked to evaluate the effectiveness of all the offline and online touchpoints in the customer journey and also map the optimal routes towards purchase. The general standard in this situation is to scope the entire journey as a marketing mix campaign to assess the effectiveness of every media channel. Take the paid, earned and owned media channels spends along with macroeconomic indicators to look for emerging causalities as a sum of:</p> <ol> <li>A seasonal baseline (the sales the model believes we would have without any marketing)</li> <li>Marketing activities (ad campaigns, pricing, promotions)</li> <li>Product development initiatives (formulation changes, enhancements, launches)</li> <li>Competitor effects (competitor's campaigns, pricings, promotions)</li> <li>Macro influences (economy, exchange rates, Covid-19 lockdowns)</li> </ol> <p>What this does not do is -</p> <ul> <li>Explain the attribution of specific interactions. MMM provides extremely high level insights which are a wholistic report card of sorts of the complete marketing efficacy. -At the same time you are also very dependent on external macroeconomic factors which are consistently changing over time. -MMM models are largely very resource intensive and most difficult task is to collect reliable and accurate data about a companies marketing and sales as well as competitors.

The industry answer is Multi-Touch Attribution Modeling (MTA).</p> <p>Multi-touch attribution is a method used in marketing analytics to measure the impact of individual touchpoints or channels on a customer's path to conversion. It aims to allocate proper credit to each touchpoint, helping marketers understand the effectiveness of their marketing efforts and optimize their strategies accordingly</p> <p>Understanding the consumer decision journey is where the MTA model really shines. Thats not to say that its a frictionless solution without limitations. Our purchase journey today has been quite an extensive process and is in no way linear. The consumer journey has many touchpoints and inputs that taps and stress tests the brand funnel. MTA helps businesses navigate the complex and non-linear path customers take from discovering a brand to making a purchase and beyond.</p> <p>MMM is an older practice developed in the 1960s. While it does explain the media effectiveness and encompasses the most significant factors that influences the consumer, the result is just too broad. The marketing landscape has drastically evolved over the last few decades especially with globalization. This requires marketeers to take a more tactical and surgical approach to get an accurate picture of the consumer journey. Ultimately, this allows companies to make continual improvements to customer lifetime value experience and lifecycle, fueling brand loyalty for years to come.</p>","tags":["modeling","marketing","attribution"]},{"location":"blog/2023/12/14/introduction-to-multi-touch-attribution-modeling-part-1/#the-marketers-perspective","title":"The Marketers Perspective","text":"<p>The fundamental objective of consumer research is to mitigate the risks associated with the behavior. Furthermore, consumers engage in research to maintain a sense of autonomy and control over purchasing behaviors. The emphasis being on 'maintaining' a sense of autonomy while not fully exercising any such form of control over behaviors. It is argued that this power dynamic between consumers and suppliers is shifting with the growth of contemporary web-based economy. Organizations today must regain control of this power shift by managing the technological empowerment of consumers. The valuation of customer loyalty rises significantly from this perspective since consumers can switch to a competition brand in search of a better value proposition.</p> <p>In conclusion, marketing strategies have always sought to identify those consumption moments or touchpoints of influence. Traditional marketing funnels play hand in hand with the aggressive push-style communication along those touchpoints.

In the previous post we did mention the streamlined consumer decision model but there is no saying that model would be applicable to a B2B software company. Its possible for your usecase you might not need to deep dive into the loyalty loop at all but just actuate the classic journey. Simply put, a consumer interacts with multiple touchpoints before converting. These journeys can be ever so complex and the question arises how to duly attribute the credit to attribution and optimize investments on media.

Its quite common to see it in this way and to be honest its pretty robust. Google analytics' behavior flow is one such example which displays beautifully the path taken by consumers on digital channels. But, how about the journey being a mix of offline channels or a mix of online and offline both. The challenge lies in the complexity and difficulty of tracking and attributing offline conversions [[1]].</p> <p>The primary reason for the focus on digital channels in attribution models is the ease of tracking and data collection. Digital channels like email, display ads, social media, and search ads provide readily available data on user interactions, making it easier to credit each touchpoint in the customer journey. Some challenges with of attributing to brick and mortar touchpoints are:</p> <ul> <li>Determining which channel or campaign led to the offline conversion. Lets say you were walking down the street and you see a billboard, a lamp post ad and a in mall hoarding. Whats to say that the purchase you made thereafter is attributed to either one of them. In contrast, digital channels are quite easy to measure since every click, navigation, time spent on a page etc is measured which makes attribution more justifiable.</li> <li>Moreover, integrating online and offline marketing channels can be complicated due to data silos, fragmentation, and different tools, platforms, and metrics used to collect and analyze data within the organization can make it difficult to consolidate and measure the influence of each touchpoint [[2]].</li> </ul> <p>Despite these challenges, its not impossible to create attribution models integrating online and offline channels. Implementing a cross-channel attribution model can enhance the understanding of each channel's role in the customer journey, leading to informed decisions.</p>","tags":["modeling","marketing","attribution"]},{"location":"blog/2023/12/20/introduction-to-multi-touch-attribution-modeling-part-2/#to-learn-heuristically-or-not-is-the-question","title":"To Learn Heuristically, or not is the Question","text":"<p>Now that we a basic understanding of what MTAs do we can actually dive into the models. Broadly, MTA models can be either heuristic or algorithmic. It comes down to how complex the business problem is that we are trying to solve and availability of data that decides what we go with.</p> <p>Heuristics are simple rule based models that focus on approximate rather than precision. Its usually trade off favoring efficiency for a similar to right one answer rather getting the precise answer. Algorithmic models, on the other hand, use advanced statistics (and machine learning at times to build conversion prediction models from highly sequentially dependent scenarios) to objectively determine the impact of marketing touches along a customer\u2019s journey toward conversion. These models are data-driven and consider a wide array of factors, including the sequence of touchpoints, the time between them, and the context of each interaction [[3]] [[4]].</p> <p>Some advantages of using algorithmic models over heuristics are:</p> <ul> <li>Algorithmic attribution is considered the most robust method of attribution analysis, as it can provide a more accurate view of which channels are top converters [[5]]. Heuristic models are more straightforward and may be suitable for simpler marketing strategies or smaller organizations with limited data.</li> <li>Heuristic models can introduce unwanted bias considering they are rule based.</li> <li>Algorithmic models can improve over time as they analyze more data, making them particularly suitable for complex customer journeys that involve multiple online and offline touchpoints.</li> </ul> <p>Heuristic models are plenty such as last interaction, first interaction, linear, time decay, position based, last click non-direct and the list goes on. Thats because these are rule based and whats to stop from making your own strategy based custom rules. These are heuristic models since first interaction credits the conversion to the very first touchpoint while the last interaction does the opposite. Linear gives equal importance to all the touchpoints and so on.  </p> <p>   An example of of how credits are assigned within heuristic models of different types across touchpoints - Link </p> <p>Statistical models are of two main types: Shapely value and Markov chains.

Statistical models do not account for sequential dependencies, meaning that they fail to consider the preceeding channels within a sequence its impact on subsequent steps.
